# handoffctl transition and concurrency contract

This directory defines the machine-checked contract for every task-lifecycle
mutation performed by `tools/handoffctl`. The TLA+ model is an abstraction of
the Python implementation, not a replacement implementation.

## Evidence classification

[`../evidence.json`](../evidence.json) records the structured formal-evidence contract required by
Agent Workflow Quality v0.24.0. It classifies these six TLC runs as bounded-model evidence and
records the largest finite process, task, actor, project, worktree, and revision domains used by
their checked configurations. Each `.cfg` file remains authoritative for the exact bound of its
model.

The correspondence classification is `best-effort`. Passing TLC establishes the invariants and
temporal properties below only for the tracked TLA+ specifications under those finite bounds and
assumptions. The implementation tests are separate evidence that selected Python behavior
corresponds to the abstractions; neither evidence source claims or requires implementation refinement or the
correctness of Python, Git, SQLite, operating-system, kernel, filesystem, or arbitrary wrapped
commands. The explicit assumptions, non-claims, and limitations in `formal/evidence.json` are part
of this contract and must remain aligned with the configurations and runner.

## Transition contract

Every accepted lifecycle command increments `task_revision` exactly once and validates the result.
Task hierarchy edges are reciprocal and acyclic; the bounded lifecycle model includes one parent
with one child and rejects `release --status done` while that child is non-terminal. The Python
validator additionally checks arbitrary task graphs and migration preservation.
For Git authority, the task and generated projections update under the same repository lock and a
detected pre-commit failure restores them. For SQLite authority, one database transaction commits
the task first and generated projections are recoverable output. A rejected command leaves
authoritative revision, task status and owner unchanged.

| Command | Required source | Required actor/revision | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `promote` | `planned`, unowned, dependencies done | exact revision | `open` |
| `pause` | `in_progress`, owned | exact revision and owner | `blocked`, ownership and lease cleared |
| `resume` | `blocked`, unowned, paused session | exact revision and session reference | `open` |
| `unblock` | `blocked`, unowned, no current-revision session | exact revision | `open` |
| `claim` | `open`, dependencies done | owner has no active task | `in_progress`, lease set |
| `heartbeat` | `in_progress` | current owner, positive lease | lease renewed |
| `update` | `in_progress` | current owner, exact revision | active fields updated |
| `release` | `in_progress` | current owner | chosen non-active state, owner and lease cleared |
| `recover-expired` | expired `in_progress` with a valid session | exact revision | `open`, ownership cleared, session restored |
| `run` record | `in_progress`, unexpired | owner and current revision | bounded result recorded |

`release --status` currently accepts every schema status other than
`in_progress`; therefore the formal model checks releases to `planned`,
`open`, `blocked`, and `done`.

`run` checks runtime configuration and the live claim before executing outside the coordinator
lock. Immediately after execution it fsyncs a privacy-safe local journal entry, then commits the
task result before attempting live reconciliation. `HandoffctlRun.tla` proves that preflight
rejection has no external effect and that task-record or post-reconciliation failure cannot erase
journal evidence. Arbitrary command correctness remains outside the proof.

The linearization point is the successful transition while the process holds the lock below Git's
common directory. Every worktree of one local clone resolves the same lock path. Expected revisions
are checked only after acquisition, so two processes observing one revision cannot both mutate it.

For the default SQLite backend, the linearization point is the successful conditional task update
and commit inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. The database enforces active-owner, branch and
worktree uniqueness. The repository-common lock protects only disposable projection generation;
it is not the SQLite mutation lock. `HandoffctlStorage.tla` models one transaction owner, monotonic
revision accounting, prepare-before-selector migration, projection-after-commit and optional
publication that cannot roll back local authority.

## Permanent project binding

`HandoffctlBinding.tla` models an initialized coordinator bound to exactly one project. A call
from the bound project is accepted; a call from any other project preserves state. The bound
identity is constant, accepted/rejected classification matches caller identity, and weak fairness
of correct calls establishes that a correctly invoked coordinator can continue to make progress.
The implementation refines this guard by checking the profile UUID, state Git root and origin,
product identity and origin, and caller working directory before normal command execution. A
wrapped command started from a product checkout has an additional runtime guard: its Git root and
branch must match the active task's declared worktree key and branch. This command preflight is
outside the lifecycle abstraction below and does not alter the TLA+ transition relation.

## Checked properties

`Handoffctl.tla` exhaustively enumerates two processes, two tasks, every
coherent initial status/owner combination, absent, unique-valid,
unique-incoherent and duplicate pause provenance, ready and blocked dependencies,
every lifecycle command, current and stale revisions, injected pre-commit
rollback, and every process interleaving. `HandoffctlLocks.tla` separately
enumerates three processes as readers and writers, including two simultaneous
readers, a competing writer, and bounded lock-wait timeout. TLC checks:

- exclusive-lock mutual exclusion and a single linearization point;
- coherent ownership and at most one active task per actor;
- no lost or duplicate accepted mutation through exact revision accounting;
- atomic task/projection revision advancement and rollback;
- reciprocal, bounded acyclic parent/child edges and done-rollup admission;
- rejection of invalid source, owner, dependency, and revision combinations;
- rejection of pause/external-block cross-mode transitions without mutation;
- rejection of missing, incoherent, or duplicate provenance for paused resume;
- timeout without state mutation when another process holds the lock;
- acceptance of eligible recovery despite simultaneous expiries and an unrelated repository
  finding;
- deadlock freedom and eventual completion under weak process/lock fairness.

Two processes are sufficient for pairwise lifecycle races in the general model; its two tasks cover
the one-active-task-per-actor invariant. `HandoffctlRecovery.tla` separately starts two tasks as
simultaneously expired claims owned by two distinct actors while an unrelated repository finding
persists. Without injected I/O failure or lock timeout, which the general transition and lock
models cover, it proves every eligible held recovery is accepted and both distinct claims are
eventually recovered.

The separate three-process lock model covers two readers plus one writer and two worktree
identities resolving one repository-common lock.
`HandoffctlRun.tla` covers preflight rejection, external execution, durable journaling, task-record
failure, and post-reconciliation success or failure. The binding model covers the configured
project and one foreign caller, including rejection without mutation and fair progress. These are
exhaustive proofs of the abstractions, not proofs of Linux, Git, Python, or the filesystem
implementation.

`HandoffctlStorage.tla` checks both selected backends, transaction mutual exclusion, one accepted
revision increment per process, prepared SQLite authority before selector switch, eventual command
completion and eventual migration switch under weak fairness. Real independent-process tests connect
that abstraction to SQLite WAL, busy deadlines, conditional updates and database constraints.

## Refinement obligations and assumptions

The implementation satisfies the model only while all of these obligations
hold:

1. Every cooperating reader and writer uses the repository-common coordinator lock below Git's
   common directory; the filesystem implements local POSIX `flock(2)` semantics. Separate clones,
   NFS, and non-cooperating direct file/Git writers are outside the proof boundary.
2. Task and projection replacement is atomic, validation occurs before commit,
   and detected pre-commit exceptions restore every touched path.
3. Lock acquisition and internal Git/GitHub scans have finite deadlines.
   External scheduling is weakly fair: a continuously runnable waiter
   eventually runs.
4. A process holding the lock eventually exits its critical section. Arbitrary
   `SIGKILL`, kernel failure, storage loss, and power loss during a multi-file
   transaction require reconciliation and are not claimed as atomic.
5. A failed push after a successful local commit does not roll back that durable
   commit; replication is retried by reconciliation.
6. SQLite processes use separate connections to one database on the same host and supported local
   filesystem. WAL shared-memory locking on NFS or other rejected network filesystems is outside the
   contract. The busy timeout bounds contention; weakly fair scheduling is required for eventual
   writer completion.
7. The SQLite transaction is durable before projection or publication. Projection files may be
   temporarily stale after a crash and are recoverable with `reconcile`.

The focused implementation tests exercise the real `flock`, atomic replacement,
rollback, concurrent mutation/reconciliation, revision fencing, ownership and
generated-view behavior. The model and tests must both pass before a
`handoffctl` change is accepted.

## CI scope

`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs these models for coordinator changes. Downstream integrations
use path-filtered formal gates so ordinary high-frequency coordinator-state commits do not start
the expensive model checker.

## Run locally

```bash
formal/handoffctl/verify.sh
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

`verify.sh` downloads the official TLA+ 1.7.4 verifier into a temporary
directory and verifies its pinned SHA-256 before execution. It does not retain
the JAR or modify coordinator state.

Formal tiers are explicit: `verify.sh --tier portable-smoke` runs one model
and is non-exhaustive; it cannot produce publication or full evidence.
`verify.sh --tier pr-publication` checks every invariant family. Five models
use their full configurations; the general lifecycle model uses the
one-process `HandoffctlPR.cfg`, while the separate lock and recovery models
retain independent-process races. This exact-head PR tier is not the complete
two-process lifecycle cross-product and cannot produce full release evidence.
`verify.sh --tier full-exhaustive` runs all six full configurations on the
scheduled weekly or manually dispatched gate. A release claim requires its
fresh exact-head full attestation; neither smaller tier substitutes for it.

Each model is executed through `tools/tlc_runner.py`, never directly through
TLC. The runner uses finite workers (`2`), a `4096m` heap for cgroup-contained
same-repository publication and weekly runs, a `512m` heap for hosted smoke, CPU
quota (`200%`), process limit (`64`), a 1200-second ordinary PR or 6000-second
release-sensitive/weekly per-model deadline, and cgroup memory/swap limits (`6G`/`6G`) for contained runs
and (`3G`/`3G`) for hosted smoke. A canonical host-wide admission lock prevents
multiple formal jobs from competing for memory while leaving coordinator worker
processes and leases untouched. A durable per-job queue record survives caller
death for stale-job recovery; completed, failed, and canceled outcomes retain
the exact resource bounds and exit classification. `systemd-run` owns the process group (`KillMode=control-group`) on hosts with a user systemd bus. Hosted CI selects an explicit `portable` containment mode: GNU `timeout` and `prlimit` enforce aggregate address-space, process-count, CPU-time, and wall-clock limits; the runner fails closed if either tool is unavailable.

The runner retains `/tmp/agent-workflow-coordinator-tlc-admission.lock` as the canonical
publication lock. The verifier uses that shared admission path by default. For an isolated
clean-destination diagnostic on a host where the shared path is inaccessible, the verifier accepts
an explicit private queue and lock pair:

```bash
formal/handoffctl/verify.sh --tier portable-smoke \
  --diagnostic-queue /absolute/private-tlc-queue \
  --diagnostic-admission-lock /absolute/private-tlc-admission.lock
```

Both distinct absolute paths are required together and are propagated as explicit runner CLI
arguments; there is no verifier environment override. The resulting attestation is classified
`diagnostic-private-admission`, sets `canonical_publication_evidence` to false, and states that it
cannot support publication or release claims. Hosted and checked-in workflows omit these flags and
therefore retain the canonical shared admission path and fail-closed publication semantics.
